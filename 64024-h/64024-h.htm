<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Thou</span> mother of the Aenead race, delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men and deities, bountiful Venus, thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who under the sky’s gliding constellations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fillest ship-carrying ocean with thy presence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the corn-bearing lands, since through thy power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each kind of living creature is conceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then riseth and beholdeth the sun’s light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before thee and thine advent the winds and clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven take flight, O goddess: daedal earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puts forth sweet-scented flowers beneath thy feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding thee the smooth deep laughs, the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows calm and shines with wide-outspreading light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon as the day’s vernal countenance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been revealed, and fresh from wintry bonds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blows the birth-giving breeze of the West wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First do the birds of air give sign of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess, and thine approach, as through their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine influence smites. Next the wild herds of beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound over the rich pastures and swim through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapid streams, as captured by thy charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each one with eager longing follows thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whithersoever thou wouldst lure them on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus through seas, mountains and rushing rivers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the birds’ leafy homes and the green plains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking bland love into the hearts of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the cause that following his lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each should renew his race after his kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore since thou alone art nature’s mistress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since without thine aid naught can rise forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the glorious regions of the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught grow to be gladsome and delectable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee would I win to help me while I write<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These verses, wherein I labour to describe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of things in honour of my friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This scion of the Memmian house, whom thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast willed to be found peerless all his days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every grace. Therefore the more, great deity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant to my words eternal loveliness:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cause meanwhile that the savage works of warfare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over all seas and lands sink hushed to rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou alone hast power to bless mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tranquil peace; since of war’s savage works<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mavors mighty in battle hath control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who oft flings himself back upon thy lap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite vanquished by love’s never-healing wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so with upturned face and shapely neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrown backward, feeds with love his hungry looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing on thee, goddess, while thus he lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supine, and on thy lips his spirit hangs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er him thus couched upon thy holy body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thou bend down to enfold him, and from thy lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour tender speech, petitioning calm peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O glorious divinity, for thy Romans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nor can we in our country’s hour of trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toil with a mind untroubled at our task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet may the famed child of Memmius<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lest my gifts, which with loving diligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set out for you, ere they be understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You should reject disdainfully. For now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the most high theory of the heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the deities, I will undertake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell you in my discourse, and will reveal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first beginnings of existing things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of which nature gives birth and increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nourishment to all things; into which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature likewise, when they have been destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolves them back in turn. These we are wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In setting forth our argument, to call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matter, or else begetting particles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to name them the seeds of things: again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As primal atoms we shall speak of them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because from them first everything is formed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When prostrate upon earth lay human life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visibly trampled down and foully crushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath religion’s cruelty, who meanwhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the regions of the heavens above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed forth her face, lowering down on men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horrible aspect, first did a man of Greece<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare to lift up his mortal eyes against her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first was he to stand up and defy her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him neither stories of the gods, nor lightnings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heaven with muttering menaces could quell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the more did they arouse his soul’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen valour, till he longed to be the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break through the fast-bolted doors of nature.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore his fervent energy of mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevailed, and he passed onward, voyaging far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the flaming ramparts of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranging in mind and spirit far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the unmeasured universe; and thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A conqueror he returns to us, bringing back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge both of what can and what cannot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise into being, teaching us in fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon what principle each thing has its powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore now has religion been cast down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath men’s feet, and trampled on in turn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves heaven-high his victory exalts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Herein this fear assails me, lest perchance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You should suppose I would initiate you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a school of reasoning unholy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set your feet upon a path of sin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereas in truth often has this religion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given birth to sinful and unholy deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So once at Aulis did those chosen chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hellas, those most eminent among heros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foully defile the Trivian Virgin’s altar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Iphianassa’s lifeblood. For so soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fillet wreathed around her maiden locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed down in equal lengths from either cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon as she was aware of her father standing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful by the altar, and at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priestly ministers hiding the knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk shedding tears at sight of her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless in terror, dropping on her knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the earth she sank down. Nor in that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anguish might it avail her that she first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given the name of father to the king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by the hands of men lifted on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuddering to the altar she was borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that, when the due ceremonial rites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been accomplished, she might be escorted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the clear-sounding hymenaeal song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that a stainless maiden foully stained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the very season of marriage she might fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sorrowful victim by a father’s stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so there might be granted to the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy and hallowed sailing. Such the crimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto religion has had power to prompt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet there may come a time when you yourself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrendering to the terror-breathing tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seers and bards, will seek to abandon us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay verily, how many dreams even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May they be forging for you, which might well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overturn your philosophy of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trouble all your happiness with fear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with good cause: for if men could perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there was a fixed limit to their sorrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some means they would find strength to withstand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hallowed lies and threatenings of these seers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as it is, men have no means, no power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a stand, since everlasting seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The penalties that they must fear in death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For none knows what is the nature of the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether ’tis born, or on the contrary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enters into our bodies at their birth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether, when torn from us by death, it perishes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together with us, or thereafter goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To visit Orcus’ glooms and the vast chasms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or penetrates by ordinance divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into brutes in man’s stead, as sang our own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ennius, who first from pleasant Helicon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought down a garland of unfading leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destined among Italian tribes of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win bright glory. And yet in spite of this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ennius sets forth in immortal verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That none the less there does exist a realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Acheron, though neither do our souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bodies penetrate thither, but a kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of phantom images, pale in wondrous wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence it was, so he relates, that once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghost of ever-living Homer rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, shedding salt tears, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To unfold in discourse the nature of things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore not only must we grasp the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning things on high, what principle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Controls the courses of the sun and moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by what force all that takes place on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is governed, but above all by keen thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must investigate whereof consists<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul and the mind’s nature, and what it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes before us when we wake, if then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are preyed on by disease, or when we lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried in sleep, and terrifies our minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that we seem face to face to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear those speaking to us who are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose bones the earth now holds in its embrace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor am I unaware how hard my task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Latin verses to set clearly forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The obscure truths discovered by the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiefly because so much will need new terms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deal with it, owing to our poverty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of language, and the novelty of the themes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nevertheless your worth and the delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your sweet friendship, which I hope to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompt me to bear the burden of any toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead me on to watch the calm nights through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking by means of what words and what measures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may attain my end, and shed so clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light upon your spirit, that thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your gaze may search the depths of hidden things.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This terror, then, and darkness of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs be scattered not by the sun’s beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day’s bright arrows, but by contemplation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature’s aspect and her inward law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this first principle of her design<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be our starting point: nothing is ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By divine will begotten out of nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truth the reason fear so dominates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All mortals, is that they behold on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the sky many things happening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet of these operations by no means<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can they perceive the causes, and so fancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they must come to pass by power divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore when we have understood that nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can be born out of nothing, we shall then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Win juster knowledge of the truth we seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both from what elements each thing can be formed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in what way all things can come to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the intervention of the gods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For if things came from nothing, any kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be born out of anything; naught then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would require seed. Thus men might rise from ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scaly race out of the land, while birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might suddenly be hatched forth from the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cattle and other herds and every kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild beast, bred by no fixed law of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would roam o’er tilth and wilderness alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fruit would remain constant to its tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But would change; every tree would bear all kinds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if there were not for each thing its own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begetting particles, how could they have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fixed unvarying mother? But in fact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since all are formed from fixed seeds, each is born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And issues into the borders of the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that alone wherein resides its substance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its first bodies. And for this cause all things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot be generated out of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since in each dwells its own particular power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again why do we see in spring the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corn in the summer’s heat, vines bursting forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When autumn summons them, if not because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in their own time the fixed seeds of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have flowed together, there is then revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever has been born, while the due seasons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are present, and the quickened earth brings forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safely into the borders of the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its tender nurslings? But if they were formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From nothing, they would suddenly spring up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At unfixed periods and hostile times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since there would then be no fixed particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be kept from a begetting union<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the unpropitious season of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet after the meeting of the seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lapse of time be needed for their increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they could grow from nothing. Suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small babes would become youths; trees would arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting up in a moment from the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing of the kind, ’tis plain, takes place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing that all things grow little by little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As befits, from determined seed, and growing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserve their kind: so that you may perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all things become greater and are nourished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of their own material. Furthermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without fixed annual seasons for the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth could not put her gladdening produce forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet, if kept apart from nourishment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could living creatures propagate their kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sustain life: so that with greater reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may think many things have many atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In common, as we see that different words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have common letters, than that anything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can come to being without first elements.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, why could not nature have produced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men of such mighty bulk, that they could wade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the deep places of the sea, or rend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge mountains with their hands, or in one life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overpass many living generations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not because there has been set apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A changeless substance for begetting things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what can thence arise is predetermined?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore we must confess this truth, that nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can come from nothing, since seed is required<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each thing, out of which it may be born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lift itself into the air’s soft breezes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly, since it is evident that tilled lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excel the untilled, and yield to labouring hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A richer harvest, we may thence infer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the earth there must be primal atoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these, labouring its soil, we stimulate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rise, when with the coulter we turn up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fertile clods. But if none such existed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We should see all things without toil of ours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spring forth far richer of their own accord.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Furthermore nature dissolves each form back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into its own first particles, nor ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annihilates things. For if aught could be mortal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all its parts, then it might from our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be snatched away to perish suddenly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there would be no need of any force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cause disruption of its parts, and loosen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fastenings. But in fact each is composed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of everlasting seeds; so till some force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrives that with a blow can shatter things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pieces, or can penetrate within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their empty spaces, and so break them up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature will not permit the dissolution<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anything to be seen. Again, if time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utterly destroys, consuming all the substance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whatsoever it removes from sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through lapse of ages, out of what does Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring back into the light of life the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of living creatures each after its kind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, once brought back, whence does the daedal earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feed and increase them, giving nourishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each after its kind? Whence do its own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fountains and far-drawn rivers from without<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep full the sea? Whence does the ether feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars? For infinite time and lapse of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely must long since have devoured all things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Formed of a body that must die. But if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout that period of time long past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those atoms have existed out of which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This universe of things has been composed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And recomposed, ’tis plain they are possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an immortal nature: none of them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore can turn to nothing. Then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same force and the same cause would destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things without distinction, were it not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That an eternal substance held them fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A substance interwoven part with part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bonds more or less close. For without doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mere touch would be cause enough for death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing that any least amount of force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs dissolve the texture of such things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one of which had an eternal body.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in fact since the mutual fastenings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between first elements are dissimilar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their substance eternal, things endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With body uninjured, till some force arrives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong enough to dissolve the texture of each.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore no single thing ever returns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nothing, but at their disruption all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass back into the elements of matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly the rain showers perish, when the sky father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has flung them into the lap of mother earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then bright crops spring up luxuriantly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boughs on the trees are green; the trees themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow, and with fruits are laden: from this source<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover both our own race and the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beasts are nourished; for this cause we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad towns teeming with children, leafy woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With young birds’ voices singing on all sides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this cause cattle about the fertile meadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearied with fatness lay their bodies down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their swollen udders oozing falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white milk stream; for this cause a new brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounds on weak limbs over the soft grass, frisking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gamboling, their young hearts with pure milk thrilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None therefore of those things that seem to perish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utterly perishes, since nature forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thing out of another, and permits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing to be begotten, unless first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has been recruited by another’s death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now listen: since I have proved to you that things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot be formed from nothing, lest you yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should tend in any way to doubt my words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the primal particles of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can never be distinguished by the eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will proceed to give you instances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bodies which yourself you must admit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are real things, yet cannot be perceived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First the wind’s wakened force scourges the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whelming huge ships and scattering the clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes with impetuous hurricane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scouring the plains, it strews them with great trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ravages with forest-rending blasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain-tops: with such rude savagery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the wind howl and bluster and wreak its rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With menacing uproar. Therefore past all doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds must be formed of unseen particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweep the seas, the lands, the clouds of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ravaging and dishevelling them all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fitful hurricane gusts. Onward they stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Multiplying destruction, just as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soft nature of water suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoops forward in one overwhelming flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled with abundant rains by a mighty spate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of water rushing down from the high hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurtling together broken forest boughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And entire trees: nor can the sturdy bridges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustain the oncoming water’s sudden force:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such wise turbulent with much rain the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flings its whole mighty strength against the piles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a loud crashing roar it then deals havoc,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolls the huge stones on beneath its waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping before it all that stems its flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this way then wind-blasts must likewise move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when like a strong stream they have hurled themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards any quarter, they thrust things along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with repeated onslaughts overwhelm them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often in writhing eddy seizing them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear them away in swiftly circling swirl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore beyond all doubt winds are composed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unseen atoms, since in their works and ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We find that they resemble mighty rivers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which are of visible substance. Then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can perceive the various scents of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never see them coming to our nostrils:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heat too we see not, nor can we observe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold with our eyes, nor ever behold words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet must all these be of a bodily nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they are able to act upon our senses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For naught can touch or be touched except body.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothes also, hung up on a shore where waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are breaking, become moist, and then grow dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If spread out in the sun. Yet in what way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water’s moisture has soaked into them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has not been seen, nor again in what way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heat has driven it out. The moisture therefore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dispersed into tiny particles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which our eyes have no power to see at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furthermore after many revolutions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sun’s year, a finger-ring is thinned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the under side by being worn: the fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dripping eave-drops hollows out a stone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bent ploughshare of iron insensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows smaller in the fields; and we behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paving stones of roads worn down at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the footsteps of the people. Then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen statues at the city gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show right hands wearing thinner by the touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who greet them ever as they pass by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus we perceive that all such things grow less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they have been worn down: and yet what atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are leaving them each moment, that the jealous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature of vision has quite shut us out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From seeing. Finally whatever time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature gradually add to things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obliging them to grow in due proportion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No effort of our eyesight can behold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So too whenever things grow old by age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or through corruption, and wherever rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overhang the sea are gnawed away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the corroding brine, you cannot discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they are losing at any single moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus nature operates by unseen atoms.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One father<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>; from whom when the bounteous Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our mother, has drunk in the liquid drops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of moisture, then by him impregnated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bears bright crops and glad trees and the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men, bears every species of wild beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furnishing food with which all feed their bodies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead a pleasant life, and propagate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their offspring. Wherefore justly she has won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of mother. Also that which once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the earth, sinks back into the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what was sent down from the coasts of aether,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning thither, is received once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the mansions of the sky. So death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does not demolish things in such a way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to destroy the particles of matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only dissipates their union,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then recombines one element with another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so brings it to pass that all things change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shapes, alter their colours, and receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sensations, then in a moment yield them up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus you may learn how greatly it signifies<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The same primordial atoms are held bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also what motions they are mutually<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imparting and receiving: and thus too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You need no more suppose that what we see<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now to true reasoning turn your mind, I pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a new theme is struggling urgently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach your ears, a new aspect of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would now reveal itself. But there is naught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So easy, that at first it will not seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Difficult of belief, and likewise naught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So mighty, naught so wondrous, but that all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little by little abate their wonder at it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider first the colour of the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bright and pure, and all that they contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars wandering everywhere, the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the surpassing radiance of the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all these sights were now for the first time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be revealed to mortals suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without warning, what could have been described<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would have seemed more marvellous than such things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that humanity could less have dared<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nothing, I think: so wonderful had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This spectacle. Yet think how no one now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearied to satiety at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deigns to look up at the sky’s shining quarters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cease therefore to cast reason from your mind<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Weigh facts with eager judgment; and if then<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Below and above throughout the universe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no limit, as I have demonstrated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed the facts themselves proclaim the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep void reveals its nature clearly.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of motion, we must deem it in no wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Probable that this single globe of earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this one heaven alone have been created,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While outside all those particles of matter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are doing nothing: the more so that this world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was formed by nature, as the seeds of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casually colliding of their own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spontaneous motion, flocked in manifold ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, vainly, without aim or result,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last such particles combined<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From time to time the rudiments of great things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, sea, sky, and the race of living creatures.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore beyond all question we are bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To admit that elsewhere other aggregates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of matter must exist, resembling this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The seeds of things each into its own place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same manner as they were thrown together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into our world, then you must needs admit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That sky and earth and sun, moon, sea and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That else exists, are not unique, but rather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of number innumerable; since life’s deep-fixed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From her proud lords, is seen then to be acting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all things of herself spontaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the interference of the gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by the holy breasts of those divinities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in calm peace are passing tranquil days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life untroubled, who, I ask, has power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule the sum of space immeasurable?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or who to hold in his controlling hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong reins of the deep? Who can at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make all those various firmaments revolve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the fires of aether warm each one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all those fruitful earths, or at all times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be present in all places, so to cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkness by clouds, and shake the calms of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thunder, to hurl lightnings, and ofttimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shatter down his own temples, or withdraw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To desert regions, there to spend his fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise his bolt, which often indeed<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now since the birth-time of the world, since sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth’s first natal day and the sun’s origin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many atoms have been added from without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many seeds from all round, which, shooting them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither and thither, the great universe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has brought together: and by means of these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea and land have been able to increase;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus too the mansion of the sky has gained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New spaciousness, and lifted its high roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far above earth, and the air has risen with it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to each thing its own appropriate atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all distributed by blows from all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regions of space, so that they separate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into their proper elements. Moisture joins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With moisture: earth from earthy substance grows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fires generate fire, and ether ether,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Nature, the creatress, consummating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her labour, has brought all things to their last<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limit of growth; as happens, when at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which is entering the veins of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is now no more than what is flowing away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ebbing thence. In all things at this point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The age of growth must halt: at this point nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curbs increase by her powers. For all such things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you may see waxing with joyous growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And climbing step by step to matured age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive into themselves more particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than they discharge, so long as food is passing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easily into all their veins, and while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are not so widely spread as to throw off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too many atoms and to cause more waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than what their life requires for nourishment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we must surely grant that many atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are flowing away from things and leaving them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still more must be added, till at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have attained the highest pitch of growth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then age little by little breaks their powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their mature strength, as it wastes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the worse side of life. And out of doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bulkier and the wider a thing is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once its growth ceases, the more particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does it now shed around it and discharge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides: nor is food distributed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easily into all its veins, nor yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In quantity sufficient that therefrom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A supply may continually rise up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To compensate the copious emanations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which it exhales. For there is need of food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To preserve all things by renewing them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Food must uphold, food sustain everything:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all is to no purpose, since the veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail to convey what should suffice, nor yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does nature furnish all that is required.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is good reason therefore why all forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should perish, when they are rarefied by flux<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of atoms, and succumb to external blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since food must fail advanced age in the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And atoms cease not ever from outside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buffet each thing till they wear it out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overpower it by beleaguering blows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this way then it is that the walls too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great world from all sides shall be stormed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so collapsing crumble away to ruins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even now already this world’s age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is broken, and the worn-out earth can scarce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Create the tiniest animals, she who once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Created every kind, and brought to birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge shapes of wild beasts. For, as I think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither did any golden rope let down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tribes of mortal creatures from the heights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven on to the fields, nor did the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor its waves beating on the rocks create them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the same earth gave birth to them, which now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeds them from her own breast. At first moreover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself spontaneously did she create<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flourishing crops and rich vines for mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself gave them sweet fruits and joyous pastures;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which now, though aided by our toil, scarce grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To any size. Thus we wear out our oxen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the strength of our peasants: we use up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our iron tools; yet hardly do we win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sustenance from the fields, so niggardly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They grudge their produce and increase our toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now shaking his head the aged ploughman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighs ever and anon, when he beholds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labours of his hands all spent in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when with times past he compares the present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He praises often the fortune of his sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harping upon that ancient race of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rich in piety supported life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their narrow plots contentedly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the land allotted to each man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was far less in those days than now. So too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The planter of the worn-out shrivelled vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disconsolately inveighs against the march<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of time, wearying heaven with complaints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And understands not how all things are wasting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little by little, and passing to the grave<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O thou bright glory of the Grecian race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy deepset footprints firmly now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plant my steps, not so much through desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rival thee, rather because I love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore long to imitate thee: for how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should a mere swallow strive with swans; or what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might kids with tottering limbs, matched in a race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achieve against a horse’s stalwart strength?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, father, art discoverer of truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost enrich us with a father’s precepts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from thy pages, glorious sage, as bees<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Feed likewise upon all thy golden words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden words, ever worthy of endless life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon as, issuing from thy godlike mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy doctrine has begun to voice abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of things, straightway the soul’s terrors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take flight; the world’s walls open; I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things being formed and changed throughout all space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealed is the divinity of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their serene abodes, which neither winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buffet, nor clouds drench them with showers, nor snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Congealed by sharp frost, falling in white flakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Violates, but an ever-cloudless sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invests them, laughing with wide-spreading light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover all their wants nature provides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is nothing that at any time<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can minish their tranquillity of soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the other hand nowhere are visible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Acherusian quarters; and yet earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In no wise can obstruct our contemplation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all those operations that take place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath our feet throughout the nether void.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At such thoughts there comes over me a kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of godlike pleasure mixed with thrilling awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nature by thy power should be thus clearly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made manifest and unveiled on every side.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now since I have demonstrated of what kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the beginnings of all things, and how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Varying are the divers shapes wherein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are flying onward of their own free will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven in eternal motion, and in what way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of these can be formed each several thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After these themes it would seem best that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of the mind and of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be elucidated in my verses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear of Acheron driven headlong forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dread which troubles from its lowest depths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life of man, and brooding over all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the blackness of death, will not allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any pleasure to be unalloyed and pure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though men often tell us that diseases<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a life of public shame are to be feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far more than Tartarus, the house of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that they know the nature of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be of blood, or even perhaps of wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If such should be their fancy, and that so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have no need of our philosophy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from the following proof you may perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all these boasts are uttered to win praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than from conviction of the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These same men, exiled from their fatherland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banished far from human sight, disgraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By foul crime, and beset by every kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wretchedness, none the less still live on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to whatever place they bear their misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of all make offerings to the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter black sheep, and to the nether powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do sacrifice, and in their bitter plight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn their thoughts to religion far more zealously.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus you can better judge a man in stress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peril, and amidst adversities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discover what he is; for then at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The language of sincerity and truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is wrung forth from the bottom of his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mask is torn off; what is real remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover avarice and blinding lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For honours, which compel unhappy men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To overpass the bounds of right, and sometimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As partners and accomplices of crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To struggle with vast effort night and day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they emerge upon the heights of power&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These sores of life are in no small degree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fostered by fear of death. For foul contempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And biting penury are mostly thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be quite different from a pleasurable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And secure life: rather they seem to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already but a kind of lingering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gates of death. And so while men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urged by an unreal terror, long to escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from these ills and drive them far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pile up wealth by shedding civil blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubling their riches greedily, while they heap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Massacre upon massacre, rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruthlessly in the sad death of a brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shun their kinsmen’s board in hate and dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often likewise owing to this same fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pine with envy because some other man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world’s eyes is powerful, some other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gazed at, as he walks robed in bright honours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they complain that they themselves are wallowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness and in filth. Some sink their lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ruin to win statues and a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often with such force, through dread of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does hatred of life and of the sight of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seize upon mortals, that with anguished heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will destroy themselves, forgetting quite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How this fear is the well-spring of their cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This it is that enfeebles honour, this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bursts the bonds of friendship, and in fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompts them to cast all duty to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since often ere now men have betrayed their country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beloved parents, seeking so to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The realms of Acheron. For just as children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the blind darkness tremble and are afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all things, so we sometimes in the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear things that are no whit more to be dreaded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than those which children shudder at in the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagining that they will come to pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This terror, then, and darkness of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs be scattered not by the sun’s beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day’s bright arrows, but by contemplation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature’s aspect and her inward law.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First then the mind, which we shall often call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The intellect, wherein is placed the council<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And government of life, I assert to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less a part of man than feet and hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes are part of the whole living creature.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some would have it that the sense of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resides in no fixed part, but deem it rather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of vital habit of the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which by the Greeks is called a harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something that causes us to live with sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although the intellect is in no one part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as good health is often spoken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though belonging to the body, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is no one part of a healthy man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they refuse to place the sense of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one fixed part: and here to me they seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wander far indeed astray from truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For often the body, which is visible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sick, while in some other hidden part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We experience pleasure; and ofttimes again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The contrary will happen, when a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is distressed in mind, through his whole body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels pleasure: in the same way as the foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a sick man may suffer pain, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head meanwhile is in no pain at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover when the limbs are given up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soft sleep, and the wearied body lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffused without sensation, there is yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something else in us which at that same time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is stirred in many ways, and into itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receives all the emotions of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the empty troubles of the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, that the soul too dwells within the limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that it is no harmony whereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body is wont to feel, this main proof shows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the body much has been removed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet often life still lingers in our limbs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereas, when a few particles of heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been dispersed, and through the mouth some air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been forced out, suddenly that same life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserts the arteries and quits the bones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence you may learn that not all particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have functions of like moment, nor alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Support existence; but that rather those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which are the seeds of wind and warming heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the cause that life stays within the limbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore this vital heat and wind, residing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the body itself, is that which quits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our dying frame. So now that we have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of the mind and of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a part in some sense of the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us give up the name of harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was brought down from lofty Helicon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the musicians, or else they themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking it from some other source, transferred it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what was then without a name of its own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However that may be, why, let them keep it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you give heed to the rest of my discourse.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now I maintain that mind and soul are bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In union with each other, forming so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single substance, but that the lord that rules<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the body is the reasoning power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we call mind and intellect. Its seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fixed in the middle region of the breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here it is that fear and panic throb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around these parts dwell joys that soothe. Here then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the intellect or mind. The rest of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispersed through the whole body, obeys and moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the will and propulsion of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which for itself and by itself alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has knowledge and rejoices for itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When nothing at that time moves soul or body.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as, when we are attacked by pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In head or eye, we do not feel distress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through our whole body too, so often the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffers pain by itself, or is envigoured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By happiness, when all the rest of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the limbs and frame remains unstirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By any new sensation. But when the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been perturbed by some more vehement fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see the whole soul feel with it in unison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the limbs; sweating and paleness then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread over the whole body; the tongue halts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speech dies away, the eyes grow dark with mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ears ring and the limbs sink under us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeed often we see men drop down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From terror of mind. Hence easily we may learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the soul is united with the mind;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Death</span> then is nothing to us, nor one jot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does it concern us, since the nature of mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thus proved mortal. And as in times long past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We felt no unhappiness when from every side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering for conflict came the Punic hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that was beneath the height of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaken by the tumult and dismay of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuddered and quaked, and mortals were in doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whose empire all human things would fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By land and sea, so when we are no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When body and soul, whereof we were composed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into one being shall have been divorced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis plain nothing whatever shall have power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trouble us, who then shall be no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stir our senses, no, not if earth with sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ruin shall be mingled, and sea with sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even though the powers of mind and soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After they have been severed from the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were still to feel, yet that to us is nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who by the binding marriage tie between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Body and soul are formed into one being.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor if Time should collect our scattered atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After our death, and should restore them back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where they now are placed, and if once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light of light were given us, not even that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would in the least concern us, once the chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of self-awareness had been snapped asunder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So too now what we may have been before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerns us not, nor causes us distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when you look back on the whole past course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of infinite time, and think how manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be the modes of matter’s flux, then easily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May you believe this too, that these same atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which we now are formed, have often before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been placed in the same order as they are now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this can no remembrance bring us back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a break in life has since been interposed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all our atoms wandering dispersed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have strayed far from that former consciousness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if a man be destined to endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misery and suffering, he must first exist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own person at that very time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When evil should befall him. But since death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Precludes this, and forbids him to exist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was to endure distress, we may be sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in death there is nothing we need dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he who exists not cannot become miserable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that it makes no difference at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether he shall already have been born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some past time, when once he has been robbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By death that dies not of his life that dies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therefore if you should chance to hear some man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitying his own lot, that after death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either his body must decay in the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or be consumed by flames or jaws of beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then may you know that his words ring not true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in his heart there lurks some secret sting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he himself deny that he believes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any sense will remain with him in death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in fact he grants not all that he professes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor by the roots does he expel and thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self forth from life, but all unwittingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assumes that of self something will survive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when a living man forbodes that birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beasts may rend his body after death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then does he pity himself, nor can he quite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Separate and withdraw from the outcast body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fancying that that other is himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his own sense imagines it endued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he complains because he was born mortal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sees that there will be in real death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other self which living can lament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he has perished, none that will stand by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grieve over his burnt and mangled corpse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if it be an evil after death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be mauled by teeth of beasts, why should it seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less cruel to be laid out on a pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scorched with hot flames, or to be embalmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stifling honey, or to lie stiff and cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couched on the cool slab of a chilly stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to be crushed down under a weight of earth?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now no more shall thy home, nor thy chaste wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive thee in gladness, nor shall thy sweet children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run forth to meet thee and snatch kisses from thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touch thee to the heart with silent joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more canst thou be prosperous in thy doings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bulwark to thy friends. Poor wretch!” men cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How wretchedly has one disastrous day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stript thee of all life’s many benefits!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this withal they add not: “Nor henceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does craving for these things beset thee more.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This truth, could men but grasp it once in thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And follow thought with words, would forthwith set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their spirits free from a huge ache and dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thou, as thou art, sunk in the sleep of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt so continue through all time to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delivered from all feverish miseries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we who watched thee on thy dreadful pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change into ashes, we insatiably<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewept thee; nor shall any lapse of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remove that lifelong sorrow from our hearts.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who spoke thus, well might we inquire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What grief so exceeding bitter is there here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in the end all comes to sleep and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one should therefore pine with lifelong misery.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This too is oft men’s wont, when they lie feasting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine-cup in hand with garland-shaded brows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus from the heart they speak: “Brief is life’s joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For poor frail men. Soon will it be no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever afterwards may it be called back.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though a foremost evil to be feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After their death were this, that parching thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would burn and scorch them in their misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or craving for aught else would then beset them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, for none feels the want of self and life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mind and body are sunk in sleep together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all we care, such sleep might be eternal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No craving for ourselves moves us at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, when starting up from sleep a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collects himself, then the atoms of his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout his frame cannot be wandering far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their sense-stirring motions. Therefore death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs be thought far less to us than sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If less can be than what we see is nothing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the dispersion of the crowded atoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes with death, is greater; nor has ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anyone yet awakened, upon whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has once fallen the chill arrest of death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Furthermore, if Nature suddenly found voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus in person upbraided one of us:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What is it, mortal, can afflict thee so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou to such exceeding bitter grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldst yield? Why thus bemoan and bewail death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if the life thou hast lived hitherto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was pleasant to thee, and not all thy blessings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though poured into a perforated jar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have flowed through and gone thanklessly to waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not then, like a guest replete with life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thy departure, and resignedly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter, thou fool, upon secure repose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if all that thou hast enjoyed has perished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squandered away, and life is a mere grievance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why seek to add thereto, what in its turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must all come to destruction and be lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unprofitably? Why both of life and travail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou not rather make an end at once?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there is nothing more I can contrive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or find to please thee. All things are the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all times. Though thy body be not yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decayed with years, nor have thy worn-out limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grown feeble, yet all things remain the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though thou shouldst overlive all generations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, even more if thou shouldst never die.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could we answer, save that Nature’s claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was just, and her indictment a true plea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if some other more advanced in years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should miserably complain and lament death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all reason, would she not yet more justly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift up her voice and chide him with sharp speech?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hence with thy tears, buffoon. Cease thy complaints.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After thou hast enjoyed all life’s best gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou now decayest. But because thou hast yearned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always for what was absent, and despised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which was present, life has glided from thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incomplete and unprofitable. So now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thou didst look for it, at thy pillow Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has taken his stand, before thou canst depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Satisfied with existence and replete.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now resign all vanities that so ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befit thine age: come then, with a good grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise and make room for others; for thou must.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justly, I think, would she so plead with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justly reproach and chide: for things grown old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield place and are supplanted evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By new, and each thing out of something else<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be replenished; nor to the black pit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tartarus was yet any man consigned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matter is needed, that therefrom may grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeding generations: which yet all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they have lived their life, shall follow thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus it is all have perished in past times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less than thou, and shall hereafter perish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So one thing out of another shall not cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever to arise; and life is given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To none in fee, to all in usufruct.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider likewise how eternal Time’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bygone antiquity before our birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was nothing to us. In such wise does Nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show us the time to come after our death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a mirror. Is aught visible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein so appalling? aught that seems like gloom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it not more secure than any sleep?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Moreover all those things which people say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are found in Acheron’s gulf, assuredly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exist for us in life. No wretched Tantalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Numbed by vain terror, quakes, as the tale tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a huge rock hanging in the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in life rather an empty fear of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppresses mortals; and the fall they dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fortune’s fall, which chance may bring to each.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor verily entering the large breast of Tityos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he lies stretched in Acheron, do vultures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find food there for their beaks perpetually.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How vast soever his body’s bulk extends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though not nine acres merely with outspread limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cover, but the round of the whole earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet would he not be able to endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal pain, nor out of his whole body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever provide food. But here for us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a Tityos, whom, while he lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bonds of love, fretful anxieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sprung from some other craving, lacerate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living Sisyphus also we behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him who from the people fain would beg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rods and cruel axes, and each time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defeated and disconsolate must retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to beg power, which, empty as it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is never given, and in pursuit thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To endure grievous toil continually,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but to thrust uphill mightily straining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stone, which from the summit after all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls bounding back down to the level plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover to be feeding evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thankless nature of the mind, yet never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill it full and sate it with good things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As do the seasons for us, when each year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They return bringing fruits and varied charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never are we filled with life’s delights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This surely is what is told of those young brides,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though they can have no hope to fill it full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cerberus and the Furies in like manner<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where from its throat Tartarus belches forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horrible flames: which things in truth are not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can be anywhere. But there is in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dread of punishment for things ill done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible as the deeds are terrible;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to expiate men’s guilt there is the dungeon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful hurling downward from the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scourgings, mutilations and impalings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitch, the torches and the metal plate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even if these be wanting, yet the mind<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We crave some other thing, gaping wide-mouthed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always possessed by the same thirst of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fortune future time may bring, we know not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor what chance has in store for us, nor yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What end awaits us. By prolonging life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No least jot may we take from death’s duration;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought may we steal away therefrom, that so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply a less long while we may be dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore as many ages as you please<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add to your life’s account, yet none the less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will that eternal death be waiting for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not less long will that man be no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from to-day has ceased to live, than he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has died many months and years ago.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">And</span> generally to what pursuits soever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each of us is attached and closely tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on whatever tasks we have been used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spend much time, so that therein the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has borne unwonted strain, in those same tasks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We mostly seem in sleep to be engaged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lawyers imagine they are pleading causes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drafting deeds; generals that they are fighting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some pitched battle; mariners that they still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are waging with the winds their lifelong war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we that we are toiling at our task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioning ever the nature of all things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And setting our discoveries forth in books<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Written in our native tongue. And thus in general<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do all other pursuits and arts appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill men’s minds and mock them during sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with those who for many days together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have watched stage shows with unremitting zeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We generally find that when they have ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To apprehend them with their senses, yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passages remain open in the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the same images of things may enter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus the same sights for many days keep passing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their eyes, so that even when awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seem to be beholding figures dancing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moving supple limbs; also their ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem to be listening clear-toned melodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lyre’s eloquent strings, while they behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fancy the same audience, the stage too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowing with all its varied scenery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great the influence of zeal and pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of those tasks whereon not only men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wont to spend their energies, but even<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All living animals. Thus you will see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong horses, when their limbs are lying at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nevertheless in slumber sweat and pant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continually, and as though to win some prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strain their strength to the utmost, or else struggle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To start, as if the barriers were thrown open.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often hunters’ dogs while softly slumbering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will yet suddenly toss their legs about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And utter hurried yelps, sniffing the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again and again, as though following the trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild beasts they have scented: and roused from sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They often chase the empty images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stags, as if they saw them in full flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till having shaken their delusions off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They come back to themselves. But the tame brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dogs reared in the house, will shake themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And start up from the ground, as if they saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown figures and faces: and the more savage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each breed is, the more fierce must be its dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the night-time birds of various kinds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly taking flight, trouble with their wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groves of deities, when in gentle sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hawks have appeared threatening them with havoc<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battle, flying after them in pursuit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the minds of men, which greatly labouring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achieve great aims, will often during sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Act and perform the same. Kings take by storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are made captive, join battle, cry aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though assassinated then and there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many men struggle and utter groans in pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as though mangled by a panther’s fangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or savage lion’s, fill the whole neighbourhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vehement clamourings. Many in their sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discourse of great affairs, and often so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have revealed their own guilt. Many meet death:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many, as though falling with all their weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From high cliffs to the ground, are scared with terror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like men reft of reason, hardly from sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to themselves again, being quite distraught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the body’s tumult. Likewise a man will sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thirsting beside a river or pleasant spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gulp almost the whole stream down his throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innocent children also, slumber-bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often believe they are lifting up their dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a tank or broken vessel, and so pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liquid, drained from their whole body, forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaking the gorgeous-hued magnificence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Babylonian coverlets. Then too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those into the currents of whose age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first time seed is entering, when the ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulness of time has formed it in their limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From without there come images emanating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some chance body, announcing a glorious face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful colouring, that excites and stirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those parts that have grown turgid with much seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that, as if all things had been performed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The full tide overflows and stains their vesture.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This seed whereof we spoke is stirred in us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first ripening age confirms our frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For different causes move and stimulate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Different things. From man the influence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man alone rouses forth human seed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soon as, thus dislodged, it has retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its abodes throughout the limbs and frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It withdraws from the whole body, and assembling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At certain places in the system, straightway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouses at last the body’s genital parts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These places, irritated, swell with seed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the wish arises to eject it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards that whereto the fell desire tends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the body seeks that by which the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is smitten by love. For all men generally<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall towards the wound, and the blood glistens forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that direction whence the stroke was dealt us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he is at close quarters, the red drops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkle the foe. Thus he who has been struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the missiles of Venus, whether a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With womanish limbs launches the shaft, or else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some woman darting love from her whole body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yearns towards that whereby he has been wounded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longs to unite with it, and shoot the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn from the one into the other body.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dumb desire gives presage of the pleasure.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This desire we call Venus: from it came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latin name for love<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>; and from this source<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There trickled first into the heart that drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus’ honeyed sweetness, followed soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By chilling care. For though that which you love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be absent, yet are images of it present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its sweet name still haunts within your ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is wise to shun such images,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scare off from you all that feeds your love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning your mind elsewhere, and vent instead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your gathering humours on some other body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than hold them back, set once for all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the love of one, and so lay up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care and unfailing anguish for yourself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wound gathers strength and grows inveterate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By feeding, while the madness day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increases, and the misery becomes heavier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you heal the first wounds by new blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roving in the steps of vagrant Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cure them while yet fresh, or can divert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To something else the movements of your mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor does the man who shuns love go without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruits of Venus; rather he makes choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joys that bring no after-pain: for surely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure of intercourse must be more pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those that are heart-whole than for the love-sick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the very moment of possession<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passion of lovers fluctuates to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering undecidedly, nor know they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What first they would enjoy with eyes and hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they have sought, they tightly press, and cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain to the body, and often print their teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the lips, and kiss with bruising mouths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the pleasure is not unalloyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there are secret stings which stimulate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hurt that very thing, whate’er it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which those germs of madness emanate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But easily, while love lasts, Venus allays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pains; and soft delight, mingled therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bridles their bites. For in this there is hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from that very body whence proceeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their burning lust, the flame may in turn be quenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although Nature protests the opposite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must happen, since this is the one sole thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the more we have, so much the more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must the heart be consumed by fell desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For food and drink are taken within the body;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since they are wont to settle in fixed parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this way the desire for water and bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is easily satisfied: but from the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful colouring of a man there enters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing into the body to enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save tenuous images, a love-sick hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often snatched off by the wind. As when in sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thirsty man seeks to drink, and no liquid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is given to quench the burning in his limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he pursues the images of water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toiling in vain, and still thirsts, though he drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a rushing river’s midst; even so in love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus deludes lovers with images:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For neither, gaze intently as they may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can bodies satiate them, nor with their hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can they pluck anything off from the soft limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aimlessly wandering over the whole body.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when at last with limbs knit they enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower of their age, when now the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presages rapture, and Venus is in act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sow the fields of woman, eagerly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They clasp bodies and join moist mouth to mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With panted breath, imprinting lips with teeth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, for naught thence can they pluck away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor each with the whole body entering pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the other’s body; for at times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seem to wish and struggle so to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So greedily do they hug the bonds of Venus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While their limbs melt, enfeebled by the might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasure. Finally, when the gathered lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has burst forth from the frame, awhile there comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brief pause in their passion’s violent heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then returns the same madness: the old frenzy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revisits them, when they would fain discover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What verily they desire to attain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never can they find out what device<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May conquer their disease: in such blind doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They waste away, pined by a secret wound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Consider too how they consume their strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are worn out with toiling; and consider<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How at another’s beck their life is passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime their substance vanishes and is changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Babylonian stuffs; their duties languish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their reputation totters and grows sick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While at her lover’s cost she anoints herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With precious unguents, and upon her feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful Sicyonian slippers laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then doubtless she has set for her in gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big green-lit emeralds; and the sea-purple dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn out by constant use, imbibes the sweat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love’s encounters. The wealth which their fathers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had nobly gathered, becomes hair-ribbons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And head-dresses, or else may be is turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a long Greek gown, or stuffs of Alinda<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ceos. Feasts with goodly broideries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And viands are prepared, games, numerous cups,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unguents, crowns and festoons; but all in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since from the well-spring of delights some touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bitter rises, to give pain amidst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very flowers; either when the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance grows conscience-stricken, and remorse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gnaws it, thus to be spending a life of sloth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruining itself in wanton haunts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else because she has launched forth some word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left its sense in doubt, some word that clings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hungry heart, and quickens there like fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that he fancies she is casting round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes too freely, or looks upon some other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her face sees traces of a smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When love is permanent and fully prosperous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These evils are experienced; but if love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be crossed and hopeless, there are evils such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you might apprehend them with closed eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond numbering; so that it is wiser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I have taught you, to be vigilant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beforehand, and watch well lest you be snared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to avoid being tripped up in love’s toils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not so difficult as, once you are caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To issue from the nets and to break through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong meshes of Venus. None the less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when you are tangled and involved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may escape the peril, unless you stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your own way, and always overlook<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every defect whether of mind or body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her whom you pursue and long to win.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this is how men generally behave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinded by lust, and assign to those they love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good qualities which are not truly theirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we see women in various ways misformed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ugly, to be fondly loved and held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In highest favour. And a man will mock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fellows, urging them to placate Venus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they are troubled by a degrading love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet often the poor fool will have no eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his own far worse plight. The tawny is called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A honey brown; the filthy and unclean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless of order; the green-eyed, a Pallas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sinewy and angular, a gazelle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tiny and dwarfish is a very Grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but sparkle; the monstrous and ungainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A marvel, and composed of majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stammers, cannot talk, why then she lisps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mute is bashful; but the fiery-tongued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malicious gossip becomes a brilliant torch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One is a slender darling, when she scarce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can live for lack of flesh; and one half dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cough, is merely frail and delicate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the fat and full-bosomed is Ceres’ self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suckling Iacchus; the snub-nosed, a female<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silenus, or a Satyress; the thick-lipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kiss incarnate. But more of this sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were a tedious labour to recite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet be she noble of feature as you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the might of Venus emanate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every limb; still there are others too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still we have lived without her until now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still she does, and we know she does, the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all things as the ugly, and, poor wretch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfumes herself with evil-smelling scents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her maids run and hide to giggle in secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the excluded lover many a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flowers and garlands covers tearfully<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The threshold, and anoints the haughty posts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With oil of marjoram, and imprints, poor man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kisses upon the doors. Yet when at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has been admitted, if but a single breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should meet him as he enters, he would seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Specious excuses to be gone, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long-studied, deep-drawn complaint would fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the ground, and he would then convict himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of folly, now he sees he had attributed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More to her than is right to grant a mortal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to our Venuses is this unknown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore the more are they at pains to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that takes place behind the scenes of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those they would keep fettered in love’s chains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all in vain, since in imagination<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You yet may draw forth all these things to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discovering every cause for ridicule:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if she be of a mind that still can charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not malicious, you may in your turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overlook faults and pardon human frailty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor always with feigned love does the woman sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with her own uniting the man’s body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She holds him clasped, with moistened kisses sucking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lips into her lips. Nay, from the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She often does it, and seeking mutual joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woos him to run to the utmost goal of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nowise else could birds, cattle, wild beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheep and mares submit to males, except<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That their exuberant nature is in heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burning draws towards them joyously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lust of the covering mates. See you not also<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Often when, mingling her seed with the man’s,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like to the mother from the mother’s seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from the father’s seed like to the father.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mingling their parents’ features side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow from the father’s body and mother’s blood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The seeds together, roused by the goads of Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the frame, and neither of the two<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like their grandparents, and will often recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of their remoter ancestors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the parents often hold concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their bodies many primal atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled in many ways, which, handed down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the first stock, father transmits to father.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since truly these things are no more derived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a determined seed, than are our faces<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More than an equal share; as you may observe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether it be a male or female offspring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor do divine powers thwart in any man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fruitful sowing, so that he may never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive from sweet children the name of father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in sterile wedlock must live out his days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men in general fancy, and so sprinkle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altars sorrowfully with much blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heap the shrine-tables with offerings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make their wives pregnant with copious seed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vainly they importune the divinity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sortilege of the gods. For they are sterile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes from too great thickness of the seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else it is unduly thin and fluid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the thin cannot adhere and cleave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the right spots, it forthwith flows away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defeated, and departs abortively.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others again discharge a seed too thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More solid than is suitable, which either<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does not shoot forth with so far-flung a stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cannot so well penetrate where it should,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And some men will more readily fertilise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some women, and other women will conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More readily and grow pregnant from other men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many women, sterile hitherto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In several marriages, have yet at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found mates from whom they could conceive children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so become enriched with a sweet offspring.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">However fruitful, had failed so far to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A well-matched nature has been often found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they might fortify their age with children.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So important is it, if seeds are to agree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blend with seeds for purposes of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the thick encounters with the fluid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fluid with the thick. Also herein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is of moment on what diet life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is nourished; for the seed within the limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some foods is made solid, and by others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thinned and dwindled. Also in what modes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love’s bland delight is dealt with, that likewise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is of the highest moment. For in general<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women are thought more readily to conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the manner of wild beasts and quadrupeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since so the seeds can find the proper spots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breasts being bent downward, the loins raised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor have wives the least need of wanton movements.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a woman thwarts conception and frustrates it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If with her loins she joyously lures on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man’s love, and, with her whole bosom relaxed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And limp, provokes lust’s tide to overflow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then she thrusts the furrow from the share’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Direct path, turning the seed’s stroke aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its right goal. And thus for their own ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harlots are wont to move, because they wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to conceive nor lie in childbed often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise that Venus may give men more pleasure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of this surely our wives should have no need.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes, by no divine interposition<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor through the shafts of Venus, a plain woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though of inferior beauty, may be loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sometimes she herself by her behaviour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gentle ways and personal daintiness<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No man, I think, formed of a mortal body.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Majesty of our theme demands, a god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he, most noble Memmius, a god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first found out that discipline of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which now is called philosophy, and whose skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From such great billows and a gloom so dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delivered life, and steered it into a calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So peaceful and beneath so bright a light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For compare the divine discoveries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of others in old times. ’Tis told that Ceres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First revealed corn to men, Liber the juice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grape-born wine; though life without these things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might well have been sustained; and even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis said there are some people that live so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to live happily was not possible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a serene mind. Therefore more justly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this man deemed by us a god, from whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came those sweet solaces of life, which now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already through great nations spread abroad<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could they inflict upon us, or the steeds<br /></span>

<span class="i0">None, I presume: for the earth even now abounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wild beasts to repletion, and is filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shuddering terror throughout its woods, great mountains<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To perform any task? Or what new fact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could have induced them, tranquil hitherto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After so long to change their former life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it seems fitting he should take delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a new state of things, to whom the old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was painful: but for him whom in past times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he was living in felicity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No evil had befallen, for such a one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could have kindled a desire for change?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must we imagine that their life lay prostrate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness and in misery, till the birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And origin of things first dawned upon them?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, what evil had it been to us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to have been created? For whoever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has once been born, must wish to abide in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long as luring pleasure bids him stay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one who has never tasted the love of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor even been numbered in life’s ranks, what harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it for him not to have been created?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again whence first was implanted in the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pattern for begetting things? Whence too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preconception of what men should be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that they knew and imaged in their minds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they desired to make? And by what means<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could they have ever ascertained the energy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Latent in primal atoms, or what forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be produced by changes in their order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless Nature herself had given them first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sample of creation? For indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These primal atoms in such multitudes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in so many ways, through infinite time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impelled by blows and moved by their own weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been borne onward so incessantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uniting in every way and making trial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every shape they could combine to form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ’tis not strange if they have also fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into such grouping, and acquired such motions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those whereby the present sum of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is carried on and ceaselessly renewed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But even were I ignorant how things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were formed of primal elements, yet this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I have ventured to affirm, and prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only from the system of the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from much other evidence, that nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has by no means been fashioned for our benefit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By divine power; so great are the defects<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which are its bane. First, of the whole space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered by the enormous reach of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A greedy portion mountains occupy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forests of wild beasts; rocks and waste swamps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possess it, or the wide land-sundering sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, well nigh two-thirds are stolen from men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By burning heat and frost ceaselessly falling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that is left for husbandry, even that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The force of Nature soon would overspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thorns, unless resisted by man’s force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever wont for his livelihood to groan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the strong hoe, and with down-pressed plough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cleave the earth. For if we do not turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fertile clods with coulters, and subduing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil of earth, summon the crops to birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They could not of their own accord spring up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the bright air. Even then sometimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When answering our long toil throughout the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every bud puts forth its leaves and flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either the sun in heaven scorches them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With too much heat, or sudden gusts of rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or nipping frosts destroy them, or wind-storms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shatter them with impetuous whirling blasts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furthermore why does Nature multiply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nourish terrible tribes of savage beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By land and sea, dangerous to mankind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why does untimely death range to and fro?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then again, like a mariner cast ashore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By raging waves, the human infant lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked upon the ground, speechless, in want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every help needful for life, when first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature by birth-throes from his mother’s womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrusts him into the borders of the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that he fills the room with piteous wailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well he may, whose fate in life will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass through so much misery. But flocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And herds of divers kind, and the wild beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, as they grow up, have no need of rattles:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To none of them a foster-nurse must utter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond broken speech: they seek not different dresses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To suit each season: no, nor do they need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weapons nor lofty walls whereby to guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is their own, since all things for them all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Earth herself brings forth abundantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nature, the creatress manifold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First of all, since the substance of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moisture, and the light breathings of the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burning heats, of which this sum of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen to be composed, have all been formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a body that was born and that will die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a body must we likewise deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the whole nature of the world was made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For things whose parts and members we see formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a body that had birth and shapes that die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These we perceive are themselves always mortal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And likewise have been born. Since then we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the chief parts and members of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decay and are reborn, it is no less certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once for heaven and earth there was a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of origin, and will be of destruction.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Herein lest you should think that without proof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have seized this vantage, in that I have assumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth and fire to be mortal, and have not doubted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moisture and air perish, but maintained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these too are reborn and grow afresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider first how no small part of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaselessly baked by the sun’s rays and trampled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By innumerable feet, gives off a mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flying clouds of dust, which the strong winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperse through the whole atmosphere. Part too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the earth’s soil is turned to swamp by rains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While scouring rivers gnaw their banks away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furthermore whatsoever goes to augment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other thing, is in its turn restored;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since beyond all doubt the all-mother Earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen to be no less the general tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You thus may see how she is ever lessened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with new growth increases evermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next, that the sea, the rivers and the springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are always amply fed by new supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of moisture oozing up perennially,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It needs no words to explain. The vast down-flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters from all sides is proof of this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the water that is uppermost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is always taken away, it comes to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on the whole there is no overflow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partly because strong winds, sweeping the seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diminish them, and the sun in heaven unweaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fabric with his rays; partly because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water is distributed below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout all lands. For the salt is strained off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pure fluid matter, oozing back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathers together at the river-heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence in fresh current streams over the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever it finds a channel ready scooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry down its waves with liquid foot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now must I speak of air, which every hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is changed through its whole body in countless ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For always whatsoever flows from things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all borne into the vast sea of air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if it were not in its turn to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Particles back to things, recruiting them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they dissolve, all would have been long since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disintegrated, and so changed to air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore it never ceases to be born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of things, and to pass back into things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, as we know, all are in constant flux.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Likewise that bounteous fountain of clear light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun in heaven, ceaselessly floods the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fresh brightness, and momently supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place of light with new light: for each former<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emission of his radiance perishes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whatsoever spot it falls. This truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may thus learn. So soon as clouds begin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass below the sun, and as it were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break off the light’s rays, their lower part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith perishes wholly, and the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is shadow-swept, wherever the clouds move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus you may know that things have ever need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fresh illumination, and that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Former discharge of radiance perishes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in any other way could things be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sunlight, if the fountain-head itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not send forth a perpetual supply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also those lights we use here upon earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night-time, hanging lamps, and torches bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With darting beams, rich with abundant smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are in haste in like fashion to supply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New radiance with ministering fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very flames seem eager, eager to flicker;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor does the still unbroken stream of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One instant quit the spots whereon it played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So suddenly is its perishing concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the swift birth of flame from all these fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is thus then you must think sun moon and stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot forth their light from ever fresh supplies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that they always lose whatever beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come foremost; lest perchance you should believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their energy to be indestructible.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again, is it not seen that even stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By time are vanquished, that tall towers fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rocks crumble away, that shrines and idols<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gods grow worn out and dilapidate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor may the indwelling holiness prolong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounds of destiny, or strive against<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laws of Nature? Then do we not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monuments of men, fallen to ruin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unable more to endure the powerful stress<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus suddenly split off, if through the lapse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All the assaults of time, without being shattered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now contemplate that which around and above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compasses the whole earth with its embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it begets all things out of itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some have told us, and receives them back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they have perished, then the whole sky is made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a body that had birth and that must die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whatsoever nourishes and augments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other things from itself, must needs be minished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be replenished, when it receives them back.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Moreover, if there never was a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of origin when earth and heaven were born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they have always been from everlasting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then before the Theban war and Troy’s<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of other deeds as well? Whither have vanished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many exploits of so many men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why are they nowhere blossoming engrafted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the eternal monuments of fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in truth, as I think, this sum of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in its youth: the nature of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is recent, and began not long ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore even now some arts are being wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their last polish, some are still in growth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Has been discovered lately, and I myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have only now been found the very first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Able to turn it into our native words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nevertheless, if you perchance believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That long ago these things were just the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that the generations of mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perished by scorching heat, or that their cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in some great convulsion of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else that flooded by incessant rains<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Must you admit that there will come to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A like destruction of earth and heaven too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when things were assailed by such great maladies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dangers, if some yet more fatal cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had whelmed them, they would then have been dissolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In havoc and vast ruin far and wide.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With provident mind, nor verily have they bargained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What motions each should follow; but because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These primal atoms in such multitudes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in so many ways through infinite time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impelled by blows and moved by their own weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been borne onward so incessantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uniting in every way and making trial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every shape they could combine to form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore it is that after wandering wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through vast periods, attempting every kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of union and of motion, they at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collect into such groups as, suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flocking together, oftentimes become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rudiments of mighty things, of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea and sky, and the race of living creatures.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At that time neither could the disk of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be seen flying aloft with bounteous light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the stars of great heaven, nor sea, nor sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet earth nor the air, nor anything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling those things which we now behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only a sort of strange tempest, a mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered together out of primal atoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all kinds, which discordantly waged war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disordering so their interspaces, paths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Connections, weights, collisions, meetings, motions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since with their unlike forms and varied shapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They could not therefore all remain united,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor move among themselves harmoniously.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereupon parts began to fly asunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like things to unite with like, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To separate off the world, and to divide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its members, portioning out its mighty parts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is, to mark off the high heaven from earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sea by itself, that it might spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unmixed waters, and likewise the fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aether by themselves, pure and unmixed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now first the several particles of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they were heavy and close-packed, all met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together in the middle, and took up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowest places: and the more they met<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In close-packed throngs, the more did they squeeze out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those particles which were to form sea, stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun and moon, and the walls of the great world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all these are of smoother rounder seeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of much smaller elements than earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So first through porous openings in the soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire-laden aether here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bursting forth rose and lightly carried off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many fires with it, much in the same way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As often we may see when first the beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the radiant sun with golden morning light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blush through the grasses gemmed with dew, and lakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever-flowing rivers exhale mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While earth itself is sometimes seen to smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when floating aloft these vapours all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unite on high, then taking bodily shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clouds, they weave a veil beneath the heavens.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus then the light diffusive aether once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took bodily shape, and, arched round on all sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far into every quarter spreading out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with its greedy embrace hemmed in all else.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next came the rudiments of sun and moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose globes turn in the air midway between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aether and earth; for neither did the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the great aether claim them for itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they were not so heavy as to sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settle down, nor so light as to glide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the topmost borders: yet their course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the two is such, that as they roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lifelike bodies onward, they are still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parts of the whole world; even as with us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of our members may remain at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While at the same time others may be in motion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when these things had been withdrawn, the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now the ocean’s vast blue region spreads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank suddenly down, and flooded with salt surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its hollow parts. And day by day the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The encircling aether’s heats and the sun’s rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compressed the earth into a closer mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By constant blows upon its outer surface<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side, so that thus beaten upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shrank and drew together round its centre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more did the salt sweat squeezed from its body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increase by its oozings the sea’s floating plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the more did those many particles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heat and air escaping fly abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far away from the earth condensing, form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty glittering mansions of the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plains sank lower, the high mountains grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet steeper; for the rocks could not sink down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could all parts subside to one same level.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus then the earth’s ponderous mass was formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With close-packed body, and all the slime of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slid to the lowest plane by its own weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the bottom settled down like dregs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the sea, then the air, then the fire-laden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aether itself, all these were now left pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With liquid bodies. Some indeed are lighter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than others, and most liquid and light of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the airy currents aether floats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not blending with the turbulent atmosphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its liquid substance. All below, it suffers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be embroiled by violent hurricanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffers all to be tossed with wayward storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While itself gliding on with changeless sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears its own fires along. For, that the aether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May stream on steadily with one impulse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pontos demonstrates, that sea which streams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an unchanging tide, unceasingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserving as it glides one constant pace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now let us sing what cause could set the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In motion. First, if the great globe of heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolves, then we must needs maintain that air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presses upon the axis at each end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holds it from outside, closing it in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At both poles; also that there streams above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another current, moving the same way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the stars of the eternal world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll glittering onward; or else that beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is another stream, that drives the sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwards the opposite way, just as we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rivers turn mill-wheels with their water-scoops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It likewise may well be that the whole sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remains at rest, yet that the shining signs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are carried onwards; either because within them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are shut swift tides of aether, that whirl round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking a way out, and so roll their fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides through the sky’s nocturnal mansions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else that from some other source outside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An air-stream whirls and drives the fires along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else they may be gliding of themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving whithersoever the food of each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls and invites them, nourishing everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their flaming bodies throughout the whole sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it is hard to affirm with certainty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of these causes operates in this world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what throughout the universe both can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does take place in various worlds, created<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On various plans, this I teach, and proceed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To expound what divers causes may exist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the universe for the motion of the stars:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one of these in our world too must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause which to the heavenly signs imparts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their motive vigour: but dogmatically<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To assert which this may be, is in no wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The function of those advancing step by step.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now in order that the earth should be at rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world’s midst, it would seem probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That its weight gradually diminishing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should disappear, and that the earth should have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another nature underneath, conjoined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blent in union from its earliest age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those aerial portions of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein it lives embodied. For this cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is no burden, nor weighs down the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as to a man his own limbs are no weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is the head a burden to the neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do we feel that the whole body’s weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests on the feet: yet a much smaller burden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid on us from outside, will often hurt us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such great moment is it what each thing’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Function may be. Thus then the earth is not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An alien body intruded suddenly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thrust from elsewhere into an alien air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But was conceived together with the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At its first birth as a fixed portion of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as our limbs are seen to be of us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover the earth, when shaken suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With violent thunder, by its trembling shakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that is over it; which in no wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could happen, if it were not closely bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the world’s airy parts, and with the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they all, as though by common roots, cohere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One with another, from their earliest age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conjoined and blent in union. See you not too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heavy as our body’s weight may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the soul’s force, though subtle exceedingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustains it, being so closely joined and blent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In union with it? Also what has power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift the body with a nimble leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except the mind’s force that controls the limbs?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you not now perceive how great the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be of a subtle nature, when ’tis joined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a heavy body, even as with the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air is joined, and the mind’s force with us?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Also the sun’s disk cannot be much larger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor its heat be much less, than to our sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They appear to be. For from whatever distance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fires can fling light, and breathe upon our limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their warming heat, these intervening spaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take away nothing from the body of flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire is not shrunken visibly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So since the sun’s heat and the light it sheds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both reach our senses and caress our limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form also and contour of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs be seen from the earth in their true scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With neither addition nor diminishment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also the moon, whether it moves along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illuminating earth with borrowed light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or throws out its own rays from its own body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howe’er that be, moves with a shape no larger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than seems that shape which our eyes contemplate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all things which we look at from far off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through much air, seem to our vision to grow dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their contours lessen. Therefore the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing that it presents a clear aspect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And definite shape, must needs by us on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be seen on high in its defining outline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as it is, and of its actual size.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly consider all those fires of aether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see from the earth. Since fires, which here below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We observe, for so long as their flickering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remains distinct, and their heat is perceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are sometimes seen to change their size to less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or greater to some very slight extent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to their distance, you may thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know that the fires of aether can be smaller<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only by infinitesimal degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or larger by the tiniest minute fraction.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This also is not wonderful, how the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small as it is, can shed so great a light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with its flood to fill all seas and lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sky, with warm heat bathing everything.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For from this spot perhaps a single well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the whole world may open and gush out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting forth an abundant stream of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because from everywhere throughout the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such wise do the particles of heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather together, and their united mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Converges in such wise, that blazing fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streams forth here from a single fountain-head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See you not too how wide a meadow-land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One little spring of water sometimes floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overflowing whole fields? It may be also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the sun’s flame, though it be not great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heat pervades the whole air with scorching fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should the air chance to be susceptible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ready to be kindled, when it is struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tiny heat-rays. Then we sometimes see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wide-spread conflagration from one spark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch fields of corn or stubble. Perhaps too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun shining on high with ruddy torch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be surrounded by much fire and heats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisible, fire which no radiance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reveals, but laden with heat it does no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than reinforce the stroke of the sun’s rays.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor is there any single theory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certain and obvious, of how the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his summer stations passing forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaches the midwinter turning-point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Capricorn, and how coming back thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bends his course to the solstitial goal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cancer; then too how the moon is seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To traverse every month that space, whereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The journeying sun spends a year’s period.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these events, I say, no single cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can be assigned. It seems most probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the august opinion of Democritus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be the truth; the nearer to the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The several constellations move, the less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can they be borne on with the whirl of heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the lower portions of this whirl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says its speed and energy diminish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And disappear; so that little by little<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun is outstripped by the signs that follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he is far beneath the burning stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon, so he says, more than the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lower and the further from the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her course is, and the nearer to the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less can she keep even with the signs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the more languid is the whirl whereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is borne along, being lower than the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more do all the signs around her path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overtake and pass by her. Thus it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she seems to move backward to each sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More quickly, because the signs come up to her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be also that two streams of air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cross the sun’s path at fixed times, each in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowing from opposite quarters of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the first may thrust the sun away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the summer signs, until he comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his winter turning-point and the icy frost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the other from the freezing shades of cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps him right back to the heat-laden regions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the torrid constellations. And just so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must suppose that the moon and the planets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which roll in their huge orbits through huge years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May move on streams of air alternately<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From opposite quarters. Do you not also see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How clouds are shifted by opposing winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lower in directions contrary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those above? Why should not yonder stars<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon their mighty orbits through the sky?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But night covers the earth with vast darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either when after his long course the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has entered on the uttermost parts of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now grown languid has breathed forth his fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted by their journey, and worn out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By traversing much air; or else because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That same force which has borne his orb along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the earth, compels him now to turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Backward his course and pass beneath the earth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Likewise at a fixed time Matuta spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rosy dawn abroad through the sky’s borders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens out her light; either because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same sun, travelling back below the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seizes the sky beforehand, and is fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kindle it with his rays; or else because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fires meet together, and many seeds of heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wont at a fixed time to stream together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Causing new sunlight each day to be born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so ’tis told that from the mountain heights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida at daybreak scattered fires are seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These then unite as if into one globe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make up the sun’s orb. Nor yet herein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should it cause wonder that these seeds of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can stream together at a time so fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repairing thus the radiance of the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For everywhere we see many events<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the boy clothe his features with the down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of puberty, and let a soft beard fall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rains, clouds and winds happen at more or less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regular yearly seasons. For where causes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cause too why days lengthen and nights wane,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Underneath and above the earth in curves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unlike length, parts the celestial regions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into unequal halves divides his orbit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever he has subtracted from one half,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so much does he add, when he comes round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the other half, till he has reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sign of heaven where the year’s node makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night’s shade equal to the light of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the sun’s mid course between the blasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of south wind and of north, the heaven holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His turning-points apart at distances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now equalised, since such is the position<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the whole starry circle, to glide through which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun takes up the period of a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighting the earth and sky with slanting rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is shown by the arguments of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have mapped out all the quarters of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with their twelve signs spaced out in order.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else because the air in certain parts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thicker, therefore the trembling lamp of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hindered in its course beneath the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot easily force a passage through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emerge at the place where it should rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in winter-time the nights are long and lingering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the day’s radiant oriflamme comes forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else again those fires which cause the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rise from a fixed point, for a like reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wont to stream together slower or quicker<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In alternating periods of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So those would seem to speak the truth who hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every morning a new sun is born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be the moon shines because she is struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sun’s rays, and turns towards our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A larger portion of this light each day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The further she recedes from the sun’s orb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until over against him with full light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has shone forth, and as she rises up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has looked upon his setting from on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereafter in her gradual backward course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same manner she must hide her light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nearer she now glides to the sun’s fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Travelling through the circle of the signs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From an opposite direction: as those hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fancy that the moon is like a ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moves along a course below the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is also possible that she revolves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her own light, and yet shows varying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phases of brightness: for there may well be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another body which glides on beside her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obstructing and occulting her continually,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet cannot be seen, because it moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without light. Or perhaps she may turn round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a ball, let us say, whose sphere is tinged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glowing light over one-half its surface;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she turns her sphere, she may present<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Varying phases, till she has turned that side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which glows with fire towards our gazing eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she twists gradually back once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hides the luminous half of her round ball:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Chaldean sages seek to prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuting with their Babylonian doctrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The opposing science of the astronomers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as though what each sect is fighting for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might not be true, or there were any reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why you should risk embracing the one creed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less than the other. Again why every time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There should not be created a fresh moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fixed succession of phases and fixed shapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that each day this new-created moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would perish, and another in its stead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be reproduced, this were no easy task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prove by argument convincingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since there can be so many things created<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fixed succession. Thus Spring goes its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Venus, and the wingèd harbinger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus leads them on; while treading close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Zephyr’s footsteps, mother Flora strews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The path before them, covering it all over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every loveliest colour and rich scent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next in procession follows parching heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dusty Ceres in its company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Etesian blasts of the North winds.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">December brings snow and renews numb frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winter follows with teeth chattering for cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore it seems less wonderful that the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be begotten and destroyed again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At fixed times, seeing that so many things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can come to pass at times so surely fixed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Likewise the occultations of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon’s vanishings you must suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be produced by many different causes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For why should the moon be able to shut out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth from the sun’s light, and lift her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On high to obstruct him from the earthward side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blocking his fiery beams with her dark orb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet at the same time some other body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gliding on without light continually<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be supposed unable to do this?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why too should not the sun at a fixed time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow faint and lose his fires, and then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revive his light, when he has had to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through tracts of air so hostile to his flames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That awhile his fires are quenched by them and perish?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why should the earth have power in turn to rob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon of light, and likewise keep the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppressed, while in her monthly course the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glides through the clear-cut shadows of the cone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet at the same time some other body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should not have power to pass under the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or glide above the sun’s orb, breaking off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beams of light he sheds? And furthermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the moon shines with her own radiance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why in a certain region of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might she not grow faint, while she makes her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through tracts that are unfriendly to her light?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now since I have demonstrated how each thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might come to pass throughout the azure spaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great heaven, how we may know what force<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And wanderings of the moon, and in what way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their light being intercepted they might vanish<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I will go back to the world’s infancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tender age of the world’s fields, and show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What in their first fecundity they resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise into the borders of the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give in charge unto the wayward winds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the beginning the Earth brought forth all kinds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of plants and growing verdure on hillsides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all the plains: the flowering meadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone with green colour: next to the various trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was given a mighty emulous impulse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shoot up into the air with unchecked growth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As feathers, hairs and bristles first are born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On limbs of quadrupeds and on the bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of winged fowl, so the new Earth then put forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grasses and brushwood first, and afterwards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave birth to all the breeds of mortal things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sprang up many in number, in many modes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And divers fashions. For no animals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can have dropped from the sky, nor can land-creatures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have issued from the salt pools. Hence it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with good reason the Earth has won the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mother, since from the Earth all things are born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many living creatures even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise from the soil, formed by rains, and the sun’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce heat. Therefore the less strange it appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If then they arose more numerous and more large<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fostered by a new earth and atmosphere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So first of all the varied families<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tribes of birds would leave their eggs, hatched out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the spring season, as now the cicadas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer-time leave of their own accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their filmy skins in search of food and life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was the time when first the Earth produced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The race of mortal men. For in the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plenteous heat and moisture would abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that wherever a fit place occurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wombs would grow, fastened to the earth by roots:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the warmth of the infants in due time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avoiding moisture and demanding air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had broken these wombs open, then would Nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn to that place the porous ducts of the Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compelling it to exude through open veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A milk-like liquid, just as nowadays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After child-bearing every woman is filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet milk; for with her too the whole flow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nutriment sets streaming towards her breasts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth to these children furnished food, the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothing, the grass a bed, well lined with rich<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luxuriance of soft down. Moreover then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world in its fresh newness would give rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither to rigorous cold nor extreme heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor violent storms of wind, for in a like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proportion all things grow and gather strength.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therefore again and yet again I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with good reason the Earth has won and keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of Mother, since she of herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave birth to humankind, and at a period<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well nigh determined shed forth every beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That roams o’er the great mountains far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise the birds of air, many in shape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But because she must have some limit set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her time of bearing, she ceased, like a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn out by lapse of years. For Time transforms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole world’s nature, and all things must pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From one condition to another: nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continues like itself. All is in flux:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature is ever changing and compelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that exists to alter. For one thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moulders and wastes away grown weak with age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then another comes forth into light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing from obscurity. So thus Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changes the whole world’s nature, and the Earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passes from one condition to another:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that what once it bore it can no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now can bear what it did not before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And many monsters too did the Earth essay<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor could they reach the coveted flower of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor find food, nor be joined in bonds of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we see numerous conditions first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must meet together, before living things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can beget and perpetuate their kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First they must have food, then a means by which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seeds of birth may stream throughout the frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the relaxed limbs; also that the male<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or courage, or else speed, that from its origin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Moreover many by their usefulness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commended to us, continue to exist<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of lions first, and the other savage beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their courage has preserved, foxes their craft,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of faithful dogs, and the whole family<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born from the seed of burden-bearing beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also the woolly flocks and horned herds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Invited, as now waters, tumbling down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the great mountains with clear-sounding plash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summon from far the thirsting tribes of beasts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furthermore in their roamings they would visit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those renowned silvan precincts of the Nymphs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caverns wherefrom they knew that copious streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gushing forth smoothly, bathed the dripping rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The dripping rocks, o’er green moss trickling down,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sometimes welled up over the level plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yet they knew not how to employ fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to make use of skins, and clothe their bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spoils of wild beasts; but inhabiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woods, mountains, caves and forests, they would shelter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their squalid limbs in thickets, when compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun the buffeting of winds and rains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No regard could they have to a general good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did they know how to make use in common<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any laws or customs. Whatsoever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune might set before him, that would each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take as his prize, cunning to thrive and live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best might please him, each one for himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the woods Venus would join the bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lovers, whether a mutual desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the man’s violence and vehement lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had won the woman over, or a bribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of acorns, arbute-berries or choice pears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endowed with marvellous strength of hands and feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They chased the forest-roaming tribes of beasts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many with flung stones and ponderous club<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They overcame, some few they would avoid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hiding-places. And like bristly swine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as they were they flung their savage limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked upon the ground, when night o’ertook them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enveloping themselves with leaves and boughs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did they call for daylight and the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering terror-stricken about the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loud wails through the shadows of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silently, buried in sleep they lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting until the sun with rosy torch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought light into the sky. For since from childhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had been wont to see darkness and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternately begotten without fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never could they feel wonder or misgiving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest night eternal should possess the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun’s light for ever be withdrawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ’twas a worse anxiety that wild beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often made sleep unsafe for these poor wretches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For driven from their homes in sheltering rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fled at the entrance of a foaming boar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or strong lion, yielding up at dead of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their leaf-strewn beds in panic to fierce guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no more often in those days than now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would mortal men leave the sweet light of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lamentation. Each one by himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would doubtless be more likely then than now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be seized and devoured by wild beasts’ teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living food, and with his groans would fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains and forests, while he saw his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live flesh in a live monument entombed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those whom flight had saved with mangled body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that time forth would hold their trembling hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over their noisome scars, with dreadful cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invoking death, till agonising throes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rid them of life, with none to give them aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ignorant of what wounds required. But then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single day did not consign to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands on thousands, marshalled beneath standards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the turbulent waters of the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shatter upon the rocks both ships and men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that time vainly, without aim or result<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea would often rise up and turmoil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the winsome wiles of the calm deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lure men on treacherously with laughing waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While reckless seamanship was yet unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover lack of food would then consign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fainting limbs to death: now rather plenty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks men to ruin. Often for themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would they pour poison out unwittingly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To others now with subtler skill they give it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Afterwards, when they had learnt the use of huts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skins, and fire; when woman, joined with man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wedlock, dwelt apart in one abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they saw offspring born out of themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first the human race began to soften.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fire made their chilly bodies now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less able to endure the cold beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof of heaven: Venus impaired their strength:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children easily by their blandishments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke down the haughty temper of their parents.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then too neighbours began to join in bonds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of friendship, wishing neither to inflict<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor suffer violence: and for womankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children they would claim kind treatment, pleading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cries and gestures inarticulately<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all men ought to have pity on the weak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though harmony could not everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be established, yet the most part faithfully<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observed their covenants, or man’s whole race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would even then have perished, nor till now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could propagation have preserved their kind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But it was Nature that constrained their tongues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To utter various sounds; and need struck out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The names of things, in the same way almost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As impotence of tongue is itself seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To teach gesture to infants, prompting them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To point at things around them. For all creatures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine by instinct how far they can use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their natural powers. Thus before horns are born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stand out on the forehead of a calf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he is angry, he butts and charges with it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then panther cubs and lion whelps will fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With claws and feet and teeth, even at a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When teeth and claws have hardly yet been formed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also we see how the whole race of birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trusting their wings, will seek a fluttering succour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From new-fledged pinions. Therefore to suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That somebody once apportioned names to things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that from him men learnt to use words first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mere folly. For why should this one man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be able to denote all things by words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his tongue form varied sounds, yet others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the same time be deemed incapable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have done the like? Besides, if others too<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not made use of words among themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence was the preconception of their usefulness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implanted in this man, and whence was given him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The primal power to know and comprehend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he desired to do? Again, one man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not subdue by force the wills of many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And compel them to learn the names of things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is no easy labour to convince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf men, and teach them what they ought to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since not for long would they endure his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor suffer unintelligible sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruitlessly to be dinned into their ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly what should there be to wonder at<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much in this, that mankind, when their voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tongue were in full vigour, should name things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By different sounds as different feelings bade them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since dumb cattle, and even the wild beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wont to emit distinct and varied sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they feel fear or pain, or when joy moves them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This indeed may be learnt from manifest facts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the large soft mouths of Molossian dogs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin to growl, angrily laying bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hard teeth, then far different is the tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which they threaten, savagely thus drawn back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the clear sound which, when they bark outright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills the whole neighbourhood. And when they essay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gentle mood to lick their cubs, or when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They toss them with their paws, and snapping at them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenderly make as though they would devour them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With half-closed teeth, thus fondling them they yelp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a quite different sound from their deep bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When left alone in houses, or from the whimper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which crouching they shrink away from blows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furthermore does not a young stallion’s neigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem different, when he rages among the mares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced in his flower of age by winged love’s goads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From when with wide-stretched nostrils he snorts out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle signal, or when at other times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance he whinnies trembling in all his limbs?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly the race of fowl and varied birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hawks and ospreys and gulls that seek their living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the salt waters of the ocean waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utter at different times quite different cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those they make when they fight over food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or struggle with their prey. And some will change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their harsh notes in accordance with the weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As do the long-lived tribes of crows, and flocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rooks, when they are said to call for rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sometimes to be summoning wind-storms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since therefore various feelings can compel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Animals, speechless though they be, to utter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such varying sounds, how much more natural<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it that in those days men could denote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissimilar things by many different sounds!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In answer to your silent questioning here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say it was the lightning first brought fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the earth for men; and from that flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other flames have spread. Thus we behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many things blaze forth, lit by fire from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sky’s stroke has charged them with its heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when a branching tree, tossed by the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chafing the branches of another tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sways to and fro, then fire may be forced out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By violent stress of friction; and at times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot flames are kindled and flash forth from boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stems rubbing together. Of these two chances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either may first have given fire to men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next the sun taught them to cook food, heating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softening it with flame; since they would note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many things mellowing about the fields<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In subtlety and power of mind, would show them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How by new methods and by using fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To improve their former means of livelihood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings began to found cities and build forts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As refuges and strongholds for themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dividing cattle and lands, and portioning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each his share according to his beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength and intellect; for comeliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was much esteemed, and strength was paramount.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afterwards property was devised, and gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discovered, which with ease robbed both the strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful of their honours: for most men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However brave and beautiful by birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow the fortunes of the richer man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whosoever by true reason’s rule<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Governs his days, for him plain frugal living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a contented spirit is mighty wealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of a little never is there lack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet men wished to become renowned and powerful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so their fortunes on a stable base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might rest, and they, being wealthy, might have power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead a tranquil life: in vain! For while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They strove to mount to the highest pitch of honour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their path was perilous: and even although<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have reached the summit, envy will sometimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike like a thunderbolt and hurl men down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contemptuously to noisome Tartarus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since highest things, lifted above all else,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are most wont as by lightning to be blasted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By envy; so that quietly to obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is better than to crave sovereign power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lordship over realms. Therefore let men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweat drops of blood, wearying themselves in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggling along ambition’s narrow road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since from the mouths of others comes their wisdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ’tis from hearsay rather than their own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Authentic feelings, they pursue such aims:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The glorious symbol of the sovereign head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trodden bloodstained beneath the people’s feet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trampled down which before was too much feared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the very lees of anarchy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole state was reduced, while each man grasped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At lordship and dominion for himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then some among them taught how to create<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magistrates, and established codes, that all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might learn to obey laws. For now mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utterly wearied of a violent life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay languishing by reason of its feuds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore the sooner of its own free will<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For him to pass a quiet and peaceful life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose deeds transgress the bonds of public peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though he should elude both gods and men,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now what may be the cause that has spread wide<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Worshippers to frequent them on feast-days&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why this should be, ’tis easy to explain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in those early times mortals would see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waking mind the glorious images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deities and behold them in their sleep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To move their limbs and utter stately speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy of their noble aspect and great powers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also they deemed eternal life was theirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because their images continually<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would reappear, and their form did not change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most because they could not well conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beings who seemed gifted with such powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could lightly be subdued by any force.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they believed that their felicity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be beyond compare, since none of them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever troubled by the fear of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because moreover in sleep they beheld them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performing without effort many miracles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they saw how the orderings of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the year’s varying seasons would return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to fixed law, yet could they not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discover from what causes this took place.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In handing all things over to the deities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeming all to be guided by their nod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abodes of their divinities they placed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Again whose mind shrinks not with awe of gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose limbs creep not for terror, when beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The appalling stroke of thunder the parched earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shudders, and mutterings run through the vast sky?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not the peoples and the nations quake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proud kings, stricken with religious dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit quailing, lest for any wicked deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or overweening word, the heavy time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of reckoning and punishment be ripe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also when the full violence of a wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raging across the sea, sweeps o’er the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high commander of a fleet, with all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His powerful legions and his elephants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does he not supplicate the gods with vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mercy, and with craven prayers entreat them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lull the storm and grant propitious gales?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all in vain; since often none the less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized by the violent hurricane, he is whirled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onto the shoals of death. Thus evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hidden power treads human grandeur down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seems to make its sport of the proud rods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cruel axes, crushed beneath its heel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly, when the whole earth rocks under them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cities tumble with the shock, or stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In doubt, threatening to fall, what wonder is it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mortal creatures should abase themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assigning vast dominion to the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondrous powers to govern all below?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now must be told how copper gold and iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weighty silver also, and solid lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were first discovered when on the great hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire had consumed huge forests with its heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindled either by lightning from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or because men waging some forest war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had carried fire among their enemies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For terror’s sake; or else because, drawn on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the soil’s goodness, they would wish to clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fat lands and turn them unto pasturage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to kill beasts and grow rich with the spoils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hunting with the pitfall and with fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came into use before woods were enclosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nets or drawn by dogs. Howe’er that be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whatsoever cause the heat of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With terrible crackling had devoured whole forests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to their deepest roots, and throughly baked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil with fire, forth from the burning veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There would ooze and collect in cavities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streams of silver and gold, of copper too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead. When afterwards men found these metals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooled into masses glittering on the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brilliant colours, they would pick them up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attracted by their bright smooth loveliness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they would then observe how each was formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a shape similar to the imprint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hole where it lay. Next it would strike them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, melted down by heat, these could be made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run into any form and mould they pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And further could by hammering be wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into points tapering as sharp and fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they might need, so furnishing themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tools wherewith to cut down woods, hew timber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plane planks smooth, to drill and pierce and bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this they would attempt with silver and gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less than with stout copper’s mighty strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in vain, since their yielding force would fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being proved less fit to endure toil and strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those days copper was more highly esteemed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold lay despised as useless with its dull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blunted edge: now copper lies neglected,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereas gold has attained the pitch of honour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Time as it revolves is ever changing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seasons of things. What was once esteemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Becomes at length of no repute; whereon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other thing, issuing from contempt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounts up and daily is coveted more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, once discovered, blossoms out in praises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising to wondrous honour among men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, Memmius, you will easily of yourself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Understand in what way were first discovered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The properties of iron. Man’s earliest weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were hands nails teeth and stones, and boughs torn off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From forest trees, and flame and fire, as each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became known. Afterwards the force of iron<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And copper was discovered. And the use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of copper was known earlier than of iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since it was easier to be worked, and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More copiously. With copper they would till<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil of earth, with copper they stirred up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves of war, and dealt wide-gaping wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seized on lands and cattle: for all else,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being naked and unarmed, would yield to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who carried weapons. Then by slow degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword of iron made progress, while the type<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the copper sickle came to be despised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron they began to cleave the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through its use wavering war’s conflicts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were rendered equal. Earlier was the custom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mounting armed upon a horse’s back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And guiding it with reins, and dealing blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the right arm, long before men dared tempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The risks of battle in the two-horsed car.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they would learn the art to yoke two steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earlier than to yoke four, or to mount armed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon scythed chariots. Next the Poeni taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The uncouth Lucanian kine,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> with towered backs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snake-like hands, to endure the wounds of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rout great troops of martial chivalry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus miserable discord brought to birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thing after another, to appal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind’s embattled nations, every day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making addition to war’s frightfulness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Also in warfare they made trial of bulls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought to drive fierce boars against the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some sent mighty lions in their van<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With armed trainers and savage guardians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To govern them and hold them in with chains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, for heated with promiscuous carnage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They put to flight whole squadrons in their rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without distinction, tossing on every side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their terrible crests; nor could the horsemen calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their horses, panic-stricken by the roaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or turn them by the bridle against their foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The she-lions would spring fiercely on all sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the faces of their adversaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from behind seizing them off their guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would clasp and tear them wounded down to the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gripping them with their strong teeth and hooked claws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bulls would toss and trample underfoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own friends, goring the horses from beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In belly and flank, tearing the soil up savagely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce boars would rend their allies with strong tusks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staining the broken weapons with their blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put to rout both horse and foot together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steeds, to escape from the tusk’s cruel push,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would swerve aside or rearing paw the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, for with severed tendons they would crash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavily down to the earth and lie stretched out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beasts, by the keepers deemed to have been tamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficiently at home, they now would see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heated to madness in the hour of battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wounds and shouts, flight panic and uproar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No portion of all the different kinds of beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once scattered in wild flight, could they recall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often nowadays the Lucanian kine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gashed cruelly with the steel, will fly dispersed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflicting ruinous havoc on their friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus might these men have acted: yet I scarce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can think they were not able to foresee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calculate how horrible a disaster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was certain to befall both sides alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men chose to act thus, not in the hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of victory so much, as from the wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they themselves perished, to give their foes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cause to lament, being desperate through mistrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their own numbers, or through lack of arms.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The plaited garment came before the dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woven stuff. Weaving comes after iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since weaving tools need iron to fashion them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By no means else can such smooth things be made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As heddles, spindles, shuttles and clattering yarn-beams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men before womankind did Nature prompt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To work wool; for in general the male sex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is by far the more skilful and ingenious:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the rough peasants chided them so sternly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That at length they consented to resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such lighter tasks into the hands of women,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And themselves took their share in heavier toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardening with hard labour limbs and hands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Nature, the creatress, herself first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught men to sow and prompted them to graft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For berries and acorns dropping from the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would put forth in due season underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swarms of seedlings: and hence the fancy came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To insert grafts upon the boughs, and plant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young saplings in the soil about the fields.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next they would try another and yet another<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Method of tilling their loved piece of land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so could watch how kindly fostering culture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helped the earth to improve its own wild fruits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they would force the forests day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To retreat higher up the mountain-sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yield the ground below to husbandry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so meadows and ponds, rivulets, crops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad vineyards might cover hill and plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While grey-green boundary strips of olive trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might run between the fields, stretching far out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er hillock, valley and plain; as now we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole countrysides glowing with varied beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with rows of sweet fruit-bearing trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enclosed round about with joyous groves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the art of imitating with their mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liquid notes of birds, came long before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men could delight their ears by singing words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smooth tunes; and the whistlings of the zephyr<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hollow reeds first taught the husbandman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blow through hollow stalks. Then by degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They learnt those sweet sad ditties, which the pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by the fingers of the melodist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pours forth, such as are heard ’mid pathless woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forests and glades, or in the lonely haunts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shepherds, and the abodes of magic calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus would they soothe and gratify their minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When satiate with food; for all such things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give pleasure then. So often, couched together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the soft grass, beside a waterbrook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a tall tree’s boughs, at no great cost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would regale their bodies joyously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At those times chiefly when the weather smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the year’s seasons painted the green herbage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flowers. Then went round the jest, the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merry laugh, for then the rustic muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was in full force: then frolick jollity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would prompt them to enwreathe their heads and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With plaited garlands woven of flowers and leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dancing out of measure to move their limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clumsily, and with clumsy foot to beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mother earth; whence smiles and jovial laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would rise; since the more novel then and strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All such sports seemed, the more they were admired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they would find a salve for wakefulness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In giving voice to many varied tones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of winding melody, running with curved lip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the reed-pipes: and from them this custom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is handed down to watchmen nowadays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, though they have better learnt to observe time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not one whit more pleasure do they enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than once that silvan race of earth-born men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is present, if we have never known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anything more delightful, gives us pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all else, and seems to be the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if some better thing be afterwards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discovered, this will often spoil for us all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pleased us once, and change our feelings towards it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus it was acorns came to be disliked:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus were abandoned those beds of strewn grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaped leaves: the dress too of wild beast’s skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell thus into contempt. Yet I suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when it was invented it would rouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such envy, that the man who wore it first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be waylaid and slain: yet after all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would be torn to pieces among the thieves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with much bloodshed utterly destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that it never could be turned to use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore skins then, now gold and purple vex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men’s lives with cares and wear them out with war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, I think, the greater guilt is ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the cold would torment these earth-born men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked without their skins; but us no harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever can it cause to go without<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In gold thread, so we have but on our backs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plain plebeian cloak to keep us warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore mankind is always toiling vainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruitlessly wasting life in empty cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless because they will not recognise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limits of possession, nor the bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond which no true pleasure can increase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so by slow degrees this ignorance<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Among unhappy mortals, and to frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lives in a new mould and give them laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She also first bestowed a kindly solace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life, when she gave birth to one endowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With so great intellect, that man who once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth all wisdom from truth-telling lips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose glory, even when his light was quenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of his divine discoveries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undimmed by time was noised abroad, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lifted high as heaven. For when he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That well nigh all those things which need demands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man’s subsistence had been now provided,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that so far as it seemed possible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life was established in security,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men through wealth and honours and renown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had attained power and affluence, and grown proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their children’s good name, yet that not one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At home possessed a heart the less care-stricken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ceaselessly despite his wiser mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tormenting all his days, could not refrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From petulant rage and wearisome complaint;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then did he understand it was the vessel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That came within it, gathered from outside,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In part because he saw that there were holes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How as with a foul savour it defiled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And flying this way and that, whether it were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By natural chance or force, since it was Nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which has ordained it so; and by what gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet each evil men must sally forth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also he proved how mostly without cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind set darkly tossing in their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad billows of care. For just as children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the blind darkness tremble and are afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all things, so we sometimes in the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear things that are no whit more to be dreaded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than those which children shudder at in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagining that they will come to pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This terror then and darkness of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must needs be scattered not by the sun’s beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day’s bright arrows, but by contemplation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature’s aspect and her inward laws.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now that I have shown you how the sky’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mansions are mortal, and that heaven is formed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a body that had birth, and since of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That takes place and must needs take place therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have unravelled most, give further heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what remains. Since once I have made bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mount the glorious chariot of the Muses,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will now tell how in the upper air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempests of wind arise; how all sinks down<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest once more: the turmoil that has been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanishes, when its fury is appeased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will explain all else that mortals see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming to pass on earth and in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such sights as often hold them in terrified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspense of mind, humiliating themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fear of gods, and bow them grovelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the ground, because they are compelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ignorance of the causes to assign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All such things to the empire of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acknowledging their power to be supreme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those who have learnt rightly that the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead a life free from care, if yet they wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what means all things can be carried on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such above all as are perceived to happen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the ethereal regions overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are borne back again into their old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religious fears, and adopt pitiless lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom in their misery they believe to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almighty; for they are ignorant of what can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what cannot exist; in fine they know not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon what principle each thing has its powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore all the more they are led astray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By blind reasoning. So that if you cannot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fling from your mind and banish far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All such belief in falsehoods that degrade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deities, and consist not with their peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thus by you disparaged and profaned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft will their holy godheads do you hurt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that their sovereign power can be impaired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that in anger they should stoop to exact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce penalties, but because you yourself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will fancy that those placid beings throned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In serene peace, can verily be tossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By great billows of wrath: nor will you enter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a calm breast the temples of the gods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet will you be able to receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tranquil peace of spirit those images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from their holy bodies, heralding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their divine beauty, float into men’s minds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to what kind of life these errors lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be imagined. Such credulity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most veracious reasoning alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can drive far from us. And though to that end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have set forth much already, yet more still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remains for me to adorn in polished verses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inward law and aspect of the heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must now be grasped: tempests and vivid lightnings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their action and what cause sets them in motion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be described; lest, when you have mapped the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into augural divisions, you should then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quake in dismay, beholding from what quarter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flash sped in its flight, or on which side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It vanished; in what manner it pierced through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into walled places, and how, having played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant there, it leapt forth and was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet of these operations by no means<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can men perceive the causes, and so fancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they must come to pass by power divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Muse of knowledge, solace of mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the delight of gods, Calliope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Point the track out before me as I speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the white line of my final goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so with thee to guide me I may win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious crown of victory and its praise.<br /></span>
